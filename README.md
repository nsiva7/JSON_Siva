# JSON_Siva

Since many years I'm using org.json and I noticied parsing is not much efficient also there are many different JSON libraries are available
like JSON, Jackson, JSON-Simple, etc,..

But I like org.json library and I thought to upgrade org.json library and then I started parsing improvements finally it's done and I felt
that I have to help my co-developer's with this library so made it.

These are some useful parsing improvements I implemented like

JSONObject.getJSONObject(key) this can provide you JSONObject whether it is in {"key", "value"} format or "{"key", "value"}" format
and if key is not available this library will provide empty JSONObject like {}.

like this I have made many improvements in this library.
